### **Introduction**
Welcome to the Netflix Recommendation Engine project! This project is designed to build a recommendation system for Netflix users based on their viewing history and preferences. Using machine learning algorithms and data analysis, this project delivers personalized recommendations to improve the user experience on the platform.

Netflix’s recommendation system is a remarkable example of modern engineering, driven by the following factors:  
- **User Viewing History**: Tracks what you’ve watched and how you interacted with it.  
- **Behavioral Data**: Analyzes how long you watch, when you pause, and when you stop watching.  
- **Demographic Information**: Uses details like your age and location to customize recommendations.  
- **Content Metadata**: Considers features of shows and movies, such as genre, cast, and storyline.  
- **Contextual Awareness**: Adapts suggestions based on whether you’re watching on a TV or mobile device.

### **Dataset Information**
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:  
- **Id**: Unique identifiers for customers and movies.  
- **Rating**: User ratings for the movies.  
- **Genre**: Categories of the movies.  
- **Movie Name**: Titles of the movies corresponding to their IDs.

### **Steps Followed**

1. **Download the Dataset**:  
   Obtain a dataset containing customer ratings, movie genres, and other related information.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Encode categorical variables, if required.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Gain insights into user preferences and identify patterns in the data.  
   - Visualize the distribution of ratings and genres.  

4. **Model Development**:  
   - Implement recommendation algorithms such as:  
     - Collaborative filtering.  
     - Content-based filtering.  
     - Hybrid approaches.  
   - Use machine learning libraries like **Scikit-learn**.  

5. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Evaluate the recommendation models using metrics like:  
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for predicted ratings.
